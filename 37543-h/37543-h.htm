<h2>AGAINST LYING.</h2>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O 'tis a lovely thing for youth<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To walk betimes in wisdom's way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fear a lie, to speak the truth,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That we may trust to all they say!<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But liars we can never trust,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Though they should speak the thing that's true;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he that does one fault at first,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And lies to hide it, makes it two.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Have we not known, nor heard nor read<br /></span>
<span class="i1">How God abhors deceit and wrong?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How Ananias was struck dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Caught with a lie upon his tongue?<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So did his wife Sapphira die,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">When she came in, and grew so bold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As to confirm that wicked lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Which just before her husband told.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Lord delights in them that speak<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The words of truth; but every liar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must have his portion in the lake<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That burns with brimstone and with fire.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then let me always watch my lips,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Lest I be struck to death and hell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since God a book of reckoning keeps<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For every lie that children tell.<br /></span>
</div>

<h2>LOVE BETWEEN BROTHERS<br />
AND SISTERS.</h2>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Whatever brawls disturb the street,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">There should be peace at home;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where sisters dwell and brothers meet<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Quarrels should never come.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Birds in their little nests agree;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And 'tis a shameful sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When children of one family<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Fall out, and chide, and fight.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hard names at first, and threat'ning words<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That are but noisy breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May grow to clubs and naked swords,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To murder and to death.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The devil tempts one mother's son<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To rage against another:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So wicked Cain was hurried on,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Till he had kill'd his brother.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The wise will let their anger cool,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">At least before 'tis night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in the bosom of a fool<br /></span>
<span class="i1">It burns till morning light.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Pardon, O Lord, our childish rage,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Our little brawls remove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, as we grow to riper age,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Our hearts may all be love!<br /></span>

<h2>AGAINST IDLENESS AND<br />
MISCHIEF.</h2>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How doth the little busy bee<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Improve each shining hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gather honey all the day<br /></span>
<span class="i1">From every opening flower!<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How skilfully she builds her cell!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">How neat she spreads the wax!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And labors hard to store it well<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With the sweet food she makes.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In works of labor or of skill<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I would be busy too:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Satan finds some mischief still<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For idle hands to do.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In books, or work, or healthful play<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Let my first years be past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I may give for every day<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Some good account at last.<br /></span>

<h2>SOLEMN THOUGHTS ON GOD<br />
AND DEATH.</h2>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There is a God that reigns above,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Lord of the heavens, and earth, and seas:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I fear his wrath, I ask his love,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And with my lips I sing his praise.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There is a law which he has writ,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To teach us all what we must do:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My soul, to his commands submit,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For they are holy, just, and true.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There is a Gospel of rich grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Whence sinners all their comforts draw:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lord, I repent, and seek thy face,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For I have often broke thy law.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There is an hour when I must die,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Nor do I know how soon 'twill come:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thousand children, young as I,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Are call'd by death to hear their doom.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Let me improve the hours I have,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Before the day of grace is fled:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's no repentance in the grave,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">No pardon offer'd to the dead.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Just as a tree cut down, that fell<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To north or southward, there it lies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So man departs to heaven or hell,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Fix'd in the state wherein he dies.<br /></span>
</div>
</div>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>SUMMER'S EVENING.</h2>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How fine has the day been! how bright was the sun!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How lovely and joyful the course that he run;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though he rose in a mist when his race he begun,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And there follow'd some droppings of rain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now the fair traveler's come to the west,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His rays are all gold, and his beauties are best;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He paints the skies gay as he sinks to his rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And foretells a bright rising again.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Just such is the Christian. His course he begins<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the sun in a mist, while he mourns for his sins,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And melts into tears; then he breaks out and shines,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And travels his heavenly way:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when he comes nearer to finish his race<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a fine setting sun, he looks richer in grace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gives a sure hope, at the end of his days<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of rising in brighter array.<br /></span>

<h2>AGAINST QUARRELLING AND<br />
FIGHTING.</h2>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Let dogs delight to bark and bite,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For God hath made them so;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let bears and lions growl and fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For 'tis their nature, too.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But, children, you should never let<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Such angry passions rise:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your little hands were never made<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To tear each other's eyes.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Let love through all your actions run<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And all your words be mild;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Live like the blessed Virgin's Son,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That sweet and lovely child.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">His soul was gentle as a lamb;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And as his stature grew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He grew in favor both with man,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And God his Father, too.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now, Lord of all, he reigns above;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And from his heavenly throne<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sees what children dwell in love,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And makes them for his own.<br /></span>
</div>
</div>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>OUR SAVIOUR'S GOLDEN RULE.</h2>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Be you to others kind and true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As you'd have others be to you;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And neither do nor say to men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whate'er you would not take again.<br /></span>
</div>
</div>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>DUTY TO GOD AND OUR NEIGHBOUR.</h3>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Love God with all your soul and strength<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With all your heart and mind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And love your neighbour as yourself:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Be faithful, just, and kind.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Deal with another as you'd have<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Another deal with you:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What you're unwilling to receive<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Be sure you never do.<br /></span>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
